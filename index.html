              <p>I’m a Clinical Messaging Consultant looking to transition into the Web/Web App development field. I have over 6 years of experience working in financial and data analysis. During this period of time I’ve enjoyed getting to work with so many wonderful people and gain a lot of knowledge. I’ve also been able to develop valuable skills like problem solving, project management, and consulting. However, when anyone asked me if I liked my job my response was always, “It’s okay”. I responded this way because I always had this feeling that something was missing. 
              
              After thinking about it for a while I realized that missing piece was creativity. I loved my job when I was able to create tools and trackers by linking a bunch of files together and writing formulas to make it all work, but I was only able to do that some of the time. Then I found coding and have developed a real passion for it. Coding allows me limitless opportunities to geek out and use my problem solving skills but in a creative format. I now have the ability to create fun and interactive websites or build a web app that is a valuable tool for someone else to use.</p>
